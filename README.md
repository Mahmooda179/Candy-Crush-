ABOUT:
Design the popular Candy Crush game on a web portal using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery

LANGUAGES:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
jQuery

TO PLAY:
Download all files and click on html file.
To play the game, press the 'New Game' button to randomize the board. If you would like to move a piece on the board, type in the corresponding code (alphabet-letter), and if it is a valid move, then the arrows will be enabled. Press 'Crush Once' to crush any same colored candies in a row!

LIMITATIONS:
Player cannot make all possible crushes after a single move. Sometimes the crush button is disabled even when there are possible crushes on the board. The player has to make another valid move in order to crush more candies. In certain scenarios the players current move is not crushed, and instead the previous possible crushes are crushed first which can change the board layout and completely invalidate the player's move.
